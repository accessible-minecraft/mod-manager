# How to Run The App

First step for all OS types is to extract the Mod.Manager.zip file which will be extracted to Mod Manager folder containing a jar file and a `run-on-linux` file.

## For Windows:-
Run the jar file just like any other exe or executable file/

## For Linux and Mac:-

For mac and linux, you can also try running the jar file but it usally don't run, you have to run a command on terminal to run the jar file. But i've created a bash/terminal script that does the same thing for you so you don't have to use terminal. 

The file's called `run-on-unix` and it runs just like any other executable, but if it doesn't, then try right clicking on the `run-on-unix` file and find for an option similar to **run as a program**.

If that fils too, then you can open the terminal in the mod manager folder and type in the following command:-

	./run-on-unix
